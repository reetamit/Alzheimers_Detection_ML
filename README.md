# 🧠 AI-Driven Alzheimer’s Stage Classification Using MRI and Deep Learning

## 🔍 Abstruct

Alzheimer’s disease affects millions globally, yet early-stage diagnosis remains challenging due to subtle anatomical changes and limited access to expert radiologists. This project builds a transparent, interpretable AI system that classifies Alzheimer’s stages (0–3) from MRI brain scans—empowering clinicians with reliable decision support and advancing ethical medical AI.

**Key Goals:**
- Early detection to improve patient outcomes  
- Model interpretability to build clinical trust  
- Fairness and transparency across demographic subgroups  
- Open-source reproducibility for global accessibility

## 📦 Data Sources

The model is trained on publicly available **Kaggle Alzheimer’s MRI datasets**, structured into DataFrames with stage labels and metadata. All scans are anonymized and preprocessed for consistency.

## 🧪 Methods/Architechture

### 🗂️ Data Processing
- **Loading & Preprocessing**: MRI images ingested from structured DataFrames  
- **Custom PyTorch Dataset**: Handles image-label pairing and metadata parsing  
- **Image Transformation**: Resizing, normalization, and optional Mixup augmentation  

### 🧠 Model Processing
- **Architecture**: EfficientNet backbone with dynamic flattening  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Weighted loss functions and stratified sampling  
- **Training Strategy**: Mixup augmentation, early stopping, and adaptive learning rate scheduling
